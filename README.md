# ðŸ©º Dermatology Machine Learning App

This project is a simple **Streamlit web application** that predicts dermatological conditions using a trained machine learning model.  
It was developed during a **Machine Learning class session** with the lecturer as a hands-on exercise.

## Project Overview
This app allows users to input various dermatological parameters such as erythema, scaling, itching, and others.  
The model then predicts the type of skin disease based on those features.

## Features
1. User-friendly web interface built with Streamlit  
2. Real-time prediction using a pre-trained machine learning model  
3. Adjustable input sliders for clinical attributes  
4. Instant output displaying the prediction result
